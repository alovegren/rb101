# Problem: Print all odd numbers from 1 to 99, inclusive, to the console, with each number on a separate line.

# Input: None?
# Output: Multiple strings

# Explicit requirements
# - All odd numbers between 1 and 99 inclusive should be printed to the screen
# - Each odd number should be on its own line

# Algorithm
# - Initialize a counter at zero
# - Initialize a loop that runs until the counter equals 99
  # - Print the number to the screen
  # - Increment the counter by two

  index = 0

  until index >= 99
    puts index
    index += 2
  end
