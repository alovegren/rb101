# File#path is an instance method which returns a string version of a given file path name.

# File::path is a class method which seems to do the same thing.

# The difference is that one is an instance method and one is a class method. 

# Class methods are called on class objects (such as File) while instance methods are called on objects (such as a local variable which references a File)
